 An `NSSplitView` subclass that provides a method to animate the position of a

 Set the position of a divider, possibly with an animation.
 
 @discussion
    This method will use the split view's animator proxy to animate by calling
    `-setPosition:ofDividerAtIndex:`.
 
 @param position
    The new position of the divider.
 @param dividerIndex
    The index of the divider to position.
 @param    animated
    Whether the positioning should be animated.
